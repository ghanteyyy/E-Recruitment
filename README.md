# E-Recruitment System API

This project is an API-only implementation of an **E-Recruitment System**, developed during my internship. The system is designed to streamline the recruitment process by providing RESTful endpoints for managing job postings, candidate applications, and recruitment workflows.

Built using **Python with Django Framework**, the API ensures scalability, security, and efficiency to support modern recruitment requirements. It serves as the backend foundation for integrating with frontend applications or third-party systems.

Key Features:
- Job posting management
- Candidate registration and application tracking
- Authentication and authorization for users
- Data handling and API response optimization

Stay tuned for further updates and documentation!
